# Registration and Login System


## Overview
This project is a Registration and Login System developed based on the provided Figma design. The system features both a mobile and a web user interface, along with advanced functionality that includes Toast notifications displaying random text fetched via an API call to ChatGPT (implemented on a separate NodeJS server).


## Project Description
This take-home assignment was given to me to complete within a few days, and it required me to quickly learn new technologies and tools. According to the project requirements, the interfaces and server were developed as follows:
- **Mobile:** A registration and login interface built using React Native.
- **Web:** A registration and login interface built using React JS.
- **Backend Server:** A Python server hosted on Azure cloud, connected to a MongoDB database for managing user data.
- **Additional Functionality:** After registration or login, a Toast notification is displayed to the user. The content of the notification is random text obtained from an API call to ChatGPT, managed by a separate NodeJS server.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native
- **Frontend (Web):** React JS
- **Backend:** Python (hosted on Azure)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **API Integration:** OpenAI ChatGPT (via a NodeJS server)
- **User Notifications:** Toast messages

## Notes
- This assignment was a challenging take-home project that required me to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies and tools.
- Throughout the development process, I adopted creative solutions to meet both the design and functional requirements.
- The project progress and code are continuously updated on our shared GitHub repository, which is available for review and feedback.
